# Portfolio-Assignment

## Objective

For this assignment our objective was to create a Profile with the CSS and html that we learned through week 1 of the class. With a proper display of your html ability and Css modifications.

## HTML

On the Html it was pretty direct and I included the general basis of a Portfolio with links to projects or resources that we have used throughout this class. I was able to create a proper header, untitled list, proper classes and id's and use reasonable semantics for each area of the webpage. From headers, navigation, sections, articles, figures, div's and a tags. I had to constantly fix and rename certain classes and id's in order to condense my CSS and to make the Html easily legible. Personally I had to recreate the HTML because I broke down the code too detailed and began having many issues, but after my session with my tutor I was able to condense the information to be more legible

## CSS

For the CSS it was more complex and had many big parts of the code that had to be adjusted and defined. I was able to use the root element to make the colorizing of my page easier. The more difficult parts included the banner, how to make the columns in a simpler way, add a lot to the images in-order for them to line up correctly and posses the correct effects and links. Again with assistance and direction of my tutor I was able to condense my code and correct certain flex's, content justifications, and visual effects. Referencing previous lessons assisted with setting background images and specifying children semantics within the parent semantics. It took a lot of tweaking in the inspect form of the webpage in-order to get the desired outcome. Lastly we were able to create a media screen to allow the webpage to be viewed comfortably in whichever size it was to be viewed. 

## Overall

Overall it was a quite difficult task to complete since I felt the need to restart from scratch from overthinking and breaking down my original code to be too confusing for myself and, in myu opinion, for others to read. But in the end I simply restarted from scratch and picked and pulled lines from my original code to apply to the final product. With the assistance of my peers to review and the help of my tutor I was able to create this portfolio page to show the skills that have been taught and learned within this first week of class.
