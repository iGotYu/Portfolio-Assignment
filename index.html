                Hello! My name is Andrew Yu and I am a current student in the UW bootcamp course. Prior to this program I was a Bartender for the Din Tai Fung Restaurant company and a small time Twitch streamer (Link below). I have been in customer service for nearly 10 years now. And after so much time in this ive decided to make a career change with this program. 
              </p>
              <p>It took some time and a bit of research for me to commit to this program but after this first week I must say that the curriculum is very well made and give us students so many tools to succeed! BEST OF LUCK TO ALL AND THROUGH COLLABORATION WE SHALL ACHIEVE GREATNESS!!
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy traveling to explore new places! Mostly its for food but overall all my travels have been great adventures! I also power lift with my inspiration coming from a group called Barbell Brigade. They were originally a YouTube group of individuals that ended opening their own fitness gym in Los Angles. Another thing I enjoy is surfing the website specifically on YouTube to find creative inspiration. A big influence is a group of Taiwanese Americans called Wong-Fu Productions. Their content for me is always relatable and ive been a fan since they first began! (all Links are below)
